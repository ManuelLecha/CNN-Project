WARNING:tensorflow:Callbacks method `on_train_batch_end` is slow compared to the batch time (batch time: 0.0358s vs `on_train_batch_end` time: 0.0871s). Check your callbacks.
WARNING:tensorflow:From project_vgg.py:115: Model.predict_generator (from tensorflow.python.keras.engine.training) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use Model.predict, which supports generators.
WARNING:tensorflow:Your input ran out of data; interrupting training. Make sure that your dataset or generator can generate at least `steps_per_epoch * epochs` batches (in this case, 1450 batches). You may need to use the repeat() function when building your dataset.
